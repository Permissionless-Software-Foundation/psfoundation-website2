## Overview
This is a proposal to fund the development work of [Chris Troutner](https://github.com/christroutner). Chris is the founder of the Permissionless Software Foundation and currently maintains the title of 'Head Janitor'.

This proposal would fund the next three months of his work, which focuses on maintaining [FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash) infrastructure and PSF operations.

## Scope
The funds from this budget will pay a monthly salary of PSF tokens, to reward Chris for the work he does for the organization. This salary is split into two parts:
- $100 USD of tokens per week will be dispsered to him each Friday.
- 1200 tokens per week will be vested for one year.

The intent is to allow him to meet his immediate financial needs, but to also incentivize him for sustained work over time. Vested funds will be held in a multisignature wallet and will be dispersed to him after one year, at the rate of 1200 tokens per week.

The proportion of immediate vs vested rewards reflect the nature of Chris' work and the emphasis on the long-term success of the PSF that he's focused on. While this budget assumes a minimum of 10 hours per week of work, Chris typically spends far more than that, and the quantity of vested tokens reflect that.

## Budget
The table below summarizes a monthly forecast of costs for the next quarter. A token price of $0.30 is used, even though the current price of the PSF token is around $0.40. This helps ensure that this propsoal will not be under-budgeted. Any PSF tokens left over at the end of the quarter (over-budgeted) will be burned and taken out of circulation.

| Month      | PSF Tokens |
|------------|------------|
| March 2021 | 6,133       |
| April 2021 | 7,666       |
| May 2021   | 6,133       |

## Deliverables
The primary deliverables for this budget will be:
- Continued maintenance and growth of FullStack.cash infrastructure and clientel.
- Continued maintenance and growth of the PSF community and software initiatives.
- Provide guidence for other PSF developers.
- Continue the role of Head Janitor, who's primary role is to actively engage the [PSF VIP members](https://t.me/psf_vip).

Chris is expected to dedicate a minimum of 10 hours per week towards work for the PSF.
