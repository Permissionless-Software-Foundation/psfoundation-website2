## Executive Summary<a name="executiveSummary"></a>
This document lays out the business model and formation plans for the *Permissionless Software Foundation*. The Foundation will offer an SLP token on the BCH network to self-fund the development of open source software which focuses on *individual sovereignty*, with emphasis on privacy, censorship resistance, and [Agorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism).

The initial focus will be on software that fits the software as a service (SaaS) business model, as that model lends itself best to the use of a native utility token. Many ideas are borrowed from [the Bancor whitepaper](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/token-liquidity/blob/master/docs/bancor-protocol-whitepaper.pdf), such as the concepts of token liquidity and forming a community that can self-fund through a native token. See [this video](https://youtu.be/LcbHTF3zCdI) for additional background.

The Foundation will fund development of SaaS open source software projects. The value of this software will be monetized through the use of the PSF utility token. The Foundation will manage projects with the goal of creating a positive-reinforcement cycle between developers, software, and the pseudo-stable utility token.

## The Problem: Underfunded Open Source Projects<a name="problem"></a>
Funding for open source software projects is a well studied and unsolved social problem, primarily due to the concept of [code rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) in modern software development. Rather than rehash or summarize the issue, interested readers should refer to this seminal work by Nadia Eghbal:

- [Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure)

## The Solution<a name="solution"></a>
While [many business models for open source software exist](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand), all are incomplete, requiring either venture capital, corporate sponsorship, or some other small number of parties to take on a great deal of risk in order to get the project to profitability. Tokens on the other hand, hold the promise of allowing communities to self-fund, by easily tracking the labor put forth by community members and then rewarding them if the software grows in usage.

## The Permissionless Software Foundation

### Mission
The mission of the Permissionless Software Foundation is to promote *individual sovereignty* through the use of software. The Foundation will focus on the development, management, and promotion of software that makes it easy for individuals to protect their privacy, circumvent censorship, and engage in [Agorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism).

#### Tools to fight surveillance
The primary tool used to protect privacy is [the Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/). The Tor network and tor-accessible browsers like [Brave browser](https://brave.com/browser-option-a-hpa811/) work within the current [server-client paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), but they provide a layer of anonymity by hiding the server IP address inside the Tor network.

For financial privacy, cryptocurrency will be used, combined with obfuscation technologies such as [Consolidating CoinJoin](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/457b99b8033fdea5ae565687e6360323) or [CashShuffle](https://cashshuffle.com/).

#### Tools to fight censorship
The primary tool used to prevent censorship will be [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. These two peer-to-peer (p2p) networks have individually [proven](http://la3.org/~kilburn/blog/catalan-government-bypass-ipfs/) robust censorship resistance throughout their short lives. The Foundation offers software that [combine these two technologies](https://troutsblog.com/about).
