## Overview

The PSF needs to form a Minting Council to decentralize power within our organization. This is a proposal to form a [Minting Council](https://psfoundation.info/governance#the-minting-council) consisting of five well-known members. Each member will be given an NFT that can be used to include them as a signer in a multisignature wallet.

Once per quarter, the members of the Minting Council will meet to set the price of a write to the pay-to-write database ([P2WDB](https://p2wdb.com)). For this service, they will each be compensated with $20 USD worth of PSF tokens.

The proposed members to make up the initial Minting Council is as follows:

- Chris Troutner
- Daniel Gonzalez
- Stoyan Zhekov
- Aaron Shoemaker
- Aaron Sundman

# Voting

- A **YES** vote for this proposal would form the Minting Council with the members mentioned above.

- A **NO** vote would not create the Minting Council. Continued discussion would be required in the [VIP Telegram channel](https://t.me/psf_vip) before the Minting Council can be created.

If members do not cast their voting tokens, they are effectively choosing to
'abstain' and not participate in voting yes or no. But we've provided an abstain address where you can send your voting tokens, to get rid of them.
