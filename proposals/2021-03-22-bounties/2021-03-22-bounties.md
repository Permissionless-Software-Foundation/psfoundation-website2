## Overview

This is a proposal is to create a 'slush fund', to be used for community building. This is a one-time allocation of PSF tokens, set aside to be spent on bounties, tips, community promotion, and hackathon prizes.


## Scope
An amount of 10,000 PSF tokens are requested to be used for discretionary funding of unplanned events. Some of the events covered by this fund would be:

- Tipping community members that perform actions that benefit the community.
- Bounties for small tasks that can be performed by community developers.
- Hackathon prizes
- Advertising or spontaneous, unplanned marketing efforts.

The funds will be stored in a multisignature wallet and will require several members of the core management team to sign off on expenditures. Fund expenditures will be tracked in a spreadsheet, which can be viewed by VIP members upon request.

## Budget
A quantity of 10,000 PSF tokens is requested. At the current token price of $0.494 per token, this represents a potential impact of $4,940. These funds are expected to last between 3 to 12 months.


## Deliverables
There are no specific deliverables for this proposal.


# Voting

- A **YES** vote for this proposal will fund this 'slush fund' wallet.
