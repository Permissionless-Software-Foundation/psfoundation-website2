This page is a template to use for creating new proposals. This source code
of this page is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/),
the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psfoundation-website2/tree/master/proposals/2021-02-01-template).

You can submit your own proposal by making a Pull Request to
the [psfoundation-website2 repository](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psfoundation-website2), adding your proposal to a new directory, based on this template. If you
have questions, ask in the [PSF VIP channel](https://t.me/psf_vip). Only PSF
community members that have enough merit to access the VIP room are allowed to
submit proposals for funding.

## Overview

This is where you would write an 'executive summary' of the proposal. This should
be a one or two paragraph summary of the project being proposed. It should
answer these questions:

- What is the proposed token budget?
- Why is this project being proposed?
- What benefits will the PSF community see if they fund this proposal?

## Scope

This is where you can go into detail on the scope of the proposal. What's inside
the scope? What's outside the scope?

How long will the project last? Generally projects aren't expected to last longer
than three months. If they do, they are expected to solicit proposals on a
quarter basis.

## Budget

Go into detail here on the budget. Tables and charts are welcomed. How many tokens
is it going to cost? How did you come up with these numbers? How much margin
are you factoring for volatility?

## Deliverables

What is the metric for success? How will the community know when this proposal
has 'succeeded'? What are final features or benefits that will be delivered
when this project is completed?

# Voting

This section will be modified by PSF management. It will clearly outline what
a 'Yes' vote or a 'No' vote means within the context of this proposal. It will
also be assigned two SLP addresses for casting votes.

If members do not cast their voting tokens, they are effectively choosing to
'abstain' and not participate in voting yes or no.

This information will be modified. The information here now is just for illustration
purposes.
