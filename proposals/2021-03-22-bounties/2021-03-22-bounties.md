## Overview

This is proposal is to create a 'slush fund' to be use for community building. This is a one-time allocation of PSF tokens, set aside to be spent on bounties, tips, community promotion, and hackathon prizes.


## Scope
An amount of 10,000 PSF tokens are request to be used for discretionary funding of unplanned events. Some of the events covered by this fund would be:

- Tipping community members that perform actions that benefit the community.
- Bounties for small tasks that can be performed by community developers.
- Hackathon prizes
- Advertising or spontaneous, unplanned marketing efforts.

The funds will be stored in a multisignature wallet and will require several members of the core management team to sign off on expenditures. Fund expenditures will be tracked in a spreadsheet, which can be viewed by VIP members upon request.

## Budget
A quantity of 10,000 PSF tokens is request. At the current token price of $0.494 per token, this represents a potential impact of $4,940. These funds are expected to last between 3 to 12 months.


## Deliverables
There are no specific deliverables for this proposal.


# Voting

- A **YES** vote for this proposal will fund this 'slush fund' wallet.

- A **NO** vote would not fund this proposal.

If members do not cast their voting tokens, they are effectively choosing to
'abstain' and not participate in voting 'yes' or 'no'. But we've provided an abstain address where you can send your voting tokens, to get rid of them.

## Token Information

10,000 voting tokens will be air-dropped to 50 addresses holding PSF tokens. The quantity of tokens received by each address will be proportional to the merit of that address. Merit is calculated as follows:

- merit = token quantity x token age (in days)

The token for this proposal will have the following ID:

- [daedc7b1829e87628d9d061f90ab9efc13225dd063f89f5052d4d6049d2cf969](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/token/daedc7b1829e87628d9d061f90ab9efc13225dd063f89f5052d4d6049d2cf969)

The token for this proposal will have the following name and ticker:

- **Name**: PSF VOTE #0002
- **Ticker**: PSFVOTE0002

The following dates and times should be noted:
- 10,000 voting tokens will be air dropped at **8PM UTC on 3/2/2021**.
- The token balances for the voting addresses above will tallied at **8PM UTC on 3/9/2021**.

## Distribution
The table below shows data on the top 50 addresses that hold the most PSF merit, and the expected distribution of voting tokens. This information will be added to each proposal so that the community can watch how these distributions change over time.
