              - Email is the most fundamental piece of identity on the internet.
              And yet, privacy-respecting email providers are rare to
              non-existent because of abuse by spammers. Cryptocurrency provides
              the answer to that problem. Studies have shown the a cost of $0.01
              to $0.05 per email is prohibitive to spammers.

              depleted of funds, more tokens can be sent to increase the quota.

              - Tor, the onion router protocol, is the exit for citizens who
              want to escape the increasingly surveilled <i>clearnet</i> web. It
              breaks the informational link between servers and clients,
              allowing both to remain anonymous and difficult to trace.
              Anonymous servers provide a <i>.onion</i> domain name, allowing a
              tor-enabled web browser to interact with them the same way itâ€™s
              done in the clearnet. These websites are often referred to as the{' '}
