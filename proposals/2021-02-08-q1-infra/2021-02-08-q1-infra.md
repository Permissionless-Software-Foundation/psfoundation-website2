## Overview
The PSF is the umbrella organization that maintains and operates [FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash), which provides free and paid infrastructure access to the Bitcoin Cash and eCash blockchains. This document is a budget proposal for Q1 of 2021, to pay for the ongoing costs of operating this infrastructure.

## Scope
The funds from this budget will pay for the infrastructure costs to maintain FullStack.cash infrastructure and services. The numbers for this budget come from expenses tracked in Q4 of 2020.

## Budget
The table below summarizes a monthly forecast of costs for the next quarter, based on expenses from the last quarter:

| | BCHN | BCHA | Auxillary | Clients | Google Drive |
|-|------|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Nov 2020 | $48.04 | $152.14 |  |  | $1.99 |
| Dec 2020 | $82.92 | $156.39 | | $62.77 | $1.99 |
| Jan 2021 | $108.35 | $182.71 | $7.68 | $116.00 | $1.99 |
| Feb 2021 (forecasted) | $150.00 | $200.00 | $50.00 | $150.00 | $1.99 |


It's difficult to forecast expenses in tokens, since they are only indirectly pegged to fiat. A value of $0.25 per PSF is assumed, and 20% error margin added. Funds will be tracked by the Business Administrator, and <u>all unused tokens at the end of the quarter will be burned</u>.

| Month  | PSF Token Budget |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February  | 2649.6  |
| March  | 2649.6  |
| April  | 2649.6  |

This budget also includes 2 hours of administrative work per week, paid in tokens, at a rate of $25 per hour.

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this budget is to simply keep the infrastructure up and running. This includes:
- 20 RPM free tier access to FullStack.cash
- 100 RPM paid tier acess to FullStack.cash
- Custom infrastructure for paying FullStack.cash clients
- As-needed infrastructure for PSF initiatives

Subscriptions from FullStack.cash will continue to go to burn PSF tokens as they have for the last two quarters. This infrastructure supports existing clients, which is estimated to burn $800 per month in PSF tokens.
